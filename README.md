## A small repo 

This is a small repo that contains some text and a `markdown` file to show off some ideas around `github` and `git`

- link [to a simple presentation](./simple-presentation/slides.md) file
- ... and [a rendered version](./simple-presentation/rendered.html) -- using `marp` in github VScode (!)

- an example of an HTML page made via `markdown` and linking other online resources (images) [flickr example](./flickr.md)
